- Provides a brief description of the current weather conditions.
- Shows sunrise and sunset times in the user's local time zone.
- Displays the minimum and maximum temperatures for the day.

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using the React JavaScript library, making it efficient and modular.
- **Geolocation API**: It uses the browser's geolocation API to determine the user's location coordinates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **CSS**: Custom CSS styles are applied to create an appealing steampunk-themed design.

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

	```bash
	cd weather-app
	npm install
	```
3. Start the development server
	```
	npm run dev
	```
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app

### API Integration

- The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- It uses environment variables to securely store the API URL and API key.
- The API response is processed and displayed to the user.

### Custom Styling

- Custom CSS styles are applied to create a steampunk-themed design.
- The design is visually appealing and complements the weather data display.

## Future Improvements

This Weather App can be further enhanced with the following features:

- **Search by Location**: Implement the ability for users to search for weather information in different cities.
- **Unit Conversion**: Allow users to switch between metric and imperial units for temperature, wind speed, and other measurements.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to provide informative messages when API requests fail.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the app's layout for mobile devices.
- **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages and date/time formats to cater to a global audience.

### create-next-app details
--------------------------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

  

## Getting Started

  

First, run the development server:

  

```bash

npm  run  dev

# or

yarn  dev

```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

  

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

  

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
